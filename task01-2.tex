Proceed just as above, but now measure the (average) run-time of the methods \keyword{la.eig}, \keyword{la.eigh}, and \keyword{la.svd}.

Here, it is highly recommended you make use of Python's \keyword{timeit} module. Examples for its proper use can be found in 
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Make sure that your run-time comparisons are fair! In other words, pay attention to the fact that \keyword{la.eig} and \keyword{la.eigh} require to compute matrix $\mat{C}$ from $\mat{X}$ whereas \keyword{la.svd} works directly on $\mat{X}$.

\begin{python}
from timeit import timeit
n = 100
eig_time = timeit(lambda: la.eig(X @ X.T), number=n)
eigh_time = timeit(lambda: la.eigh(X @ X.T), number=n)
svd_time = timeit(lambda: la.svd(X)[1] ** 2, number=n)
# print the average time spend for each method
print("la.eig:  %.3fs" % eig_time / n)
print("la.eigh: %.3fs" % eigh_time / n)
print("la.svd:  %.3fs" % svd_time / n)
\end{python}

Run your code. What do you observe ? Do your result so far suggest any preference for any of the methods considered up to this point ?

The code outputs the following:

la.eig:  0.090s \\
la.eigh: 0.024s \\
la.svd:  0.909s \\

We see that singular value decomposition is by far the slowest method. This observation can be explained by the dimensions of the matrix $X$ ($361 \times 2429$) in comparison to $C$ ($361 \times 361$). 

The fastest method is \keyword{la.eigh}. Reason for this is that \keyword{la.eigh} assumes the input matrix to be symmetric/hermitian and thus can use a faster algorithm than \keyword{la.eig}. On the other hand \keyword{la.eig} doesn't assume anything on the input matrix other than it being square.

Together with the observations from exercise 1, the prefered method for this specific problem instance is \keyword{la.eigh} for the already mentioned reasons.
